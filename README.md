# 🚀 Backend Learning Journey  
📅 Started: April 16, 2025  
🧠 Current Day: 21  
📈 Tracking Progress: 🛠️ Focused on Side Projects to Solidify Learning  

---

## ✅ Current Progress (what I know how to do)

* **Express.js**: Building full-featured APIs with modular architecture and clean routes/controllers.
* **MongoDB + Mongoose**: Database design, advanced queries, schema modeling, validations.
* **JWT authentication**: Secure login, signup, and protected route flows using token-based authentication.
* **API security best practices**: Helmet, CORS, XSS protection, NoSQL Injection protection, Rate Limiting.
* **Live deployment to Render**: Full deployment pipelines with environment variables, cloud databases (MongoDB Atlas).
* **Real-time Backend (Socket.io)**: Live updates, private rooms, event broadcasting between server and multiple clients.
* **Production Readiness**: Environment config, security middleware stack, clean error handling.
