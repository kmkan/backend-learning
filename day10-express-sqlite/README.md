# 📘 Day 10: SQL + Express Integration

Today I leveled up by connecting SQL with an Express backend! Here's what I accomplished:

## ✅ What I Learned

- Gained deeper understanding of **SQL fundamentals**
- Learned how to integrate **SQLite** with an **Express.js** backend
- Installed and used the `sqlite3` Node package

## 🛠️ What I Built

- Created a real `.db` file to hold persistent data (specifically, to hold Rubik's Cube data)
- Seeded the database with sample records
- Wrote **dynamic Express routes** that use actual SQL queries
- Successfully **queried** and **updated** the database using Express

## 🧪 Testing

- Used **Postman** to send test requests to my API
- Verified that:
  - Data is correctly retrieved
  - Records are being inserted/updated in the database

## 📦 Tools Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite
- sqlite3 (Node package)
- Postman

This was my first real full-stack experience touching a real database.
