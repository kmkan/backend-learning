# Rubik's Cube API with MongoDB and Mongoose (Modularized)

## Overview

Today, April 22nd, 2025, I continued my journey into building a robust backend for my Rubik's Cube API using MongoDB and Mongoose. Building upon the foundational CRUD operations I implemented yesterday, my focus today was on **modularizing the codebase** to improve organization, maintainability, and scalability.

The key learning today revolved around separating concerns and structuring the project in a more logical way. This involved moving database-related code into dedicated files, making the application cleaner and easier to understand.

## Key Learnings

* **Database Code Separation:** I learned the importance of isolating database connection and model definitions from the main application logic. This typically involves creating separate files for:
    * **Database Configuration:** Handling the connection to the MongoDB database (e.g., using Mongoose).
    * **Models:** Defining Mongoose schemas and creating the corresponding models for each collection (e.g., the `Cube` model).
* **Modularization Principles:** I practiced breaking down the application into smaller, self-contained modules. This makes the code more reusable, testable, and easier for others (and my future self) to navigate.
* **Import/Export:** I reinforced my understanding of JavaScript's `require()` and `module.exports` (or the more modern `import` and `export`) syntax to share code between different modules of the application.
* **Code Organization:** Overall, the focus was on establishing a clearer project structure that promotes better code organization and maintainability as the API grows.
* **Cementing Yesterday's Learning:** While working on modularization, I also reinforced the core concepts of defining Mongoose schemas, creating models, and implementing CRUD operations that I learned yesterday.
