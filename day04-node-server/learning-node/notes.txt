- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, basically means it provides everything needed in order to run
  JavaScript on your computer
- Allows you to use JavaScript to write server-side code (build backend servers, create scripts)
- Fast, efficient and scalable because Node runs Javascript on one thread and offloads
  slow tasks to be done in the background as it continues executing remaining tasks

- NPM (Node Package Manager) is the largest software registry
- 'npm init' will create a package.json file. Most importantly, this file contains
  information about the dependencies your project needs
- 'npm install' will download all dependencies listed in your package.json 
  file (you never want to deploy node_modueles to a host)
