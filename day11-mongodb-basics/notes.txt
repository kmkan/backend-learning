- MongoDB is a document database
- Documents: Data is stored as JSON documents, offering flexibility and easy mapping to application code objects
- Collections: Documents are grouped into collections, similar to tables in relational databases, but with more flexibility
- Replica Sets: Ensure high availability by automatically creating multiple copies of data
- Sharding: Distributes data across multiple machines for scalability
- Indexes: Improve query speed by allowing the app to scan the index instead of every document
- Aggregation Pipelines: Enable processing, transforming, and analyzing data at scale
