- SQL (Structured Query Language) allows you to query, transform, and manipulate data in a relational database
- An SQL table can be thought of as an entity, with each row being a specific instance of that entity 
  and each column being common properties shared by all instances
- Primary key: A value that uniquely defines the entry in the database
- Foreign key: The value of the primary key in another table,
